# Introduction

Welcome to the **NOMAD Development & Plugins Workshop** ðŸŽ‰

The goal of this workshop is to:

* Set up a complete **NOMAD development environment** on your Windows PC

* Learn how to **install, modify, and test plugins**

* Practice using **Git and GitHub** to manage changes collaboratively

* Build and deploy your own **NOMAD Oasis image**

By the end of the workshop, you will:

* Have a working local NOMAD development setup

* Understand the plugin structure and how to extend NOMAD

* Be able to contribute changes via GitHub

* Know how to package and run your own NOMAD Oasis with custom plugins

## What we will do and why

This workshop will guide you through the full development cycle:

1. **System preparation**
      - Set up WSL2 and Docker Desktop
      - Install additional software (Python, Node.js, Yarn, uv)
2. **NOMAD distro-dev**
      - Clone and run the NOMAD development distribution
3. **Plugin development**
      - Install and activate a plugin
      - Modify the plugin and test changes (via CLI and GUI)
4. **Collaboration with GitHub**
      - Push changes, open pull requests, merge into main
5. **Deployment**
      - Build and run a NOMAD Oasis image with your plugin

This end-to-end workflow mirrors how real NOMAD development is done in practice.

## Participant check

Before we dive in:

* Who already has experience with **NOMAD, Git, or Docker**?

* Who has used **WSL2 on Windows** before?

* Who has **installed VS Code** and feels comfortable with the terminal?

This helps us adapt the pace of the workshop.
